# meet-me2

One of the problems with existing applications like when2meet, doodle, etc. that help users to coordinate meeting times is that they are so tedious to use repeatedly - users have to put in virtually the same information each time they want to use the app to meet with a new person. I want to create an application that will allow users to co-ordinate meeting times by uploading their ical calendars, and/or maybe create some 'default' times they're free that they can edit each time as needed.

This is an [extension](https://github.com/angelinahli/meet-me) of a project created during [Sister Hacks 2018](http://sisterhacks.co/).

I am incredibly indebted to [Miguel Grinberg](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)'s excellent introduction to the Flask framework.

## backlog
* Create better way of managing username and password validation
* Create a test database of users
* Create a search feature to search for users
* Maybe research how to make your code more modular and easy to change
* (at this point after integrating the concept of users) research potential methods possible to have scheduling data. maybe work first on ability to modify your schedule from scratch (create "templates"?) at this point put on your designer hat and think about what makes the most sense here from a design perspective.

## done
* Learn how to properly manage user sessions and implement that
* Have the app running such that you can log in, and see users
* Write out your uml diagram - users, schedules, events.
